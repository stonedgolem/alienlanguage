##Welcome, stranger!

Welcome to my little blog, where I write about anything I'm interesting in: GNU/Linux, games, politics, society, history and whatever may come to my mind. I do this not because I think I have interesting things to say -- I do it, because I need practice in writing in English. A decade ago, when I first discovered the internet, I used it a lot to chat with people on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. Back then my English was quiet fluent, but lately I think these times are over. I got old and my tongue got rusty...

Anyway, it's never to late to end a bad development and change the way things are going. So I decided to set up a blog, where I can get a little practice. So, welcome to my little site, stranger. Sit down. Take a Rest. And look around for articles you might enjoy.

## About myself

I live with my wife and two cats in the most beautiful town I can imagine: Hamburg, Germany. Recently I left University with a Master of Arts degree. I'm still thinking about taking a shot on getting the German equivalent of a Ph.D., but I'm also into finding a good job, earning money and living a quiet life. Who knows? Maybe I'll find a way to combine both wishes.

At university I studied a strange thing. When I try to translate it, it would sound like "Culture of the technological and scientific world". It was a study which combined the realms of Humanities and Science. Maybe what I've done is described best as a historical work with really strong emphasis an technology. Although I'm no engineer nor programmer I'm used to scientific thinking. I don't know whether that combination is good enough to find me a decent job, but I love the subject.
  
##Help is welcome

As I mentioned before, this blog is about me improving my English. For publishing I use a combination of [OctoPress](http://octopress.org) and [github](http://github.com) -- the same combo that power my [original Blog](stonedgolem.de), which is maintained in German only. My posts are written in [makrdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) in a text editor called ReText, which I set to check English spelling. But that alone won't help much. I need your help. Yes, you've read right. I ask you to help me.

If you find a typo or wrong grammar in my sentence, please leave a comment of some kind. Either you use the [Disqus Comment Service](http://disqus.com) that I have integrated on all my pages and posts, or you can just send me an [email](floschulze@arcor.de).

If you like what I'm doing here you can also [flattr me a little bit](http://flattr.com). At the end of each of my posts you'll find a flattr-button which I would ask you in the case you want to flattr me. By doing so I can see which article you especially like -- and I can write a few more of them.
